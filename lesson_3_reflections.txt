When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
 - When there is other people that is working on your project too, or when you want to keep your code safe in a remote repository, you know like an online backup.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
	- Because there wiil be times that we just want to try new changes and we don't need to keep our working space updated to the new changes.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
	- Forks : You use forks when you want to "clone" a github repository to yours, you usually do this when you don't have permissions to collaborate in that repository or when you wan't to create your own version of this one.
	- Clone : You clone a repository to your local repositories, you can do it from a github-s repository or from another repository in your local
	- Branch : You create a branch IN a repository, it's about commits not about repositories

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
	- you can work without internet connection using the last know state of the remote repository, when you have 
	  internet again you can sync your remote repo and you copy ot this in your local
